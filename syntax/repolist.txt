repolist


Produces a list of configured repositories. The  default  is  to  list  all
enabled repositories. If you pass -v, for verbose mode, more information is
listed. If the first argument is ’enabled’, ’disabled’ or  ’all’  then  the
command will list those types of repos.

You can pass repo id or name arguments, or wildcards which to match against
both of those. However if the id or name matches exactly then the repo will
be listed even if you are listing enabled repos. and it is disabled.

In non-verbose mode the first column will start with a ’*’ if the repo. has
metalink data and the latest metadata is not local.  For  non-verbose  mode
the  last  column will also display the number of packages in the repo. and
(if there are any user specified excludes) the number of packages excluded.

One  last  special  feature  of repolist, is that if you are in non-verbose
mode then yum will ignore any repo errors and output the information it can
get  (Eg.  "yum clean all; yum -C repolist" will output something, although
the package counts/etc. will be zeroed out).

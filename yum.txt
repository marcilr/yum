yum is an interactive, rpm based, package manager.  It can
automatically perform system updates, including dependency
analysis and  obsolete  processing based  on  "repository"
metadata.  It  can also perform installation of new packages,
removal of old packages  and  perform  queries  on  the
installed and/or  available  packages  among many other
commands/services (see below).  yum is similar to other high
level package managers like apt-get and  smart.

While  there  are  some  graphical interfaces directly to
the yum code, more recent graphical interface development is
happening with PackageKit and  the gnome-packagekit
application.
